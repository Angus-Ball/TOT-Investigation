                      <i>This consent form is only part of the process of informed consent. Feel free to print this screen to keep a copy for your records and reference. It should give you the basic idea of what the research is about and what your participation will involve. If you would like more detail about something mentioned here or information not included here, feel free to contact the researchers listed to ask questions about this study and your participation. Please take the time to read this carefully to understand any accompanying information.</i><br/><br/>
                      <b>1. Purpose of the research</b><br/>
                      The purpose of this study is to examine what people know about words that they cannot recall.<br/><br/>
                      <b>2. Study Procedures</b><br/>
                      If you agree to participate in this study, you will study a list of words and then be asked to remember the words later during a recall test. You will be given a prompt about what the word means and then type the word if you recall it. If you indicate that you do not recall the word, you will then indicate if have any sense that it is on the tip of your tongue. You will then see four other words and select the one which you think is closest to what you were attempting to recall. Then you will be given a second opportunity to recall and type the word before the next trial. The entire study should take about 15 minutes to complete. These tasks will be conducted online in your web browser.<br/><br/>
                      <b>3. Recording devices</b><br/>
                      Your responses will be collected online using the jsPsych software platform. The program will record the recalled words that you type, your sliding-scale recollection ratings, and your button-press responses when choosing the related words.<br/><br/>
                      <b>4. Potential benefits</b><br/>
                      Participants will have the benefit of experiencing a typical cognitive psychology study. The possible benefits to society may be that this study will add to the psychological literature concerning memory retrieval and intermediate knowledge states.<br/><br/>
                      <b>5. Potential Risks</b><br/>
                      There are minimal risks associated with participating in this study.<br/><br/>
                      <b>6. Description of anonymized data</b><br/>
                      The study is hosted on GitHub and your responses will be recorded in your web-browser and sent to a Google Firebase server for secure storage. Only your SONA ID will be included in the raw data, your name will not be included. After all participants have completed the study, your data will be securely stored on the hard drive of password-protected computers in Randy Jamiesonâ€™s Cognitive Science lab (Duff Roblin P500) and on UM OneDrive. Both Angus Ball and Randy Jamieson will have access to the data. If the results are published, your name will not be used. Some information from this study may be made available to other researchers, organizations, or made publicly available for further analysis, testing, as part of the research study, a thesis, or a requirement by a granting agency or journal. Any information sent out of the University of Manitoba will not show directly or indirectly identifiable information about you. If you choose to withdraw from this study, your data will be removed and destroyed from our database. We have a master list that matches your SONA ID to your data file, which we only look at if someone wants to remove their data from the experiment. If you want to withdraw your data after completing the experiment, please send us your SONA ID and we will have it removed before July 2024. We anticipate that after the start of July 2024 we will no longer be able to remove participant data from the dataset. Representatives of The University of Manitoba Research Ethics Board may require access to your study-related records to monitor the conduct of the research.<br/><br/>
                      <b>7. Compensation</b><br/>
                      Participants will be rewarded with one (1.0) research credit toward their psychology course upon completion, or withdrawal, from the study.<br/><br/>
                      <b>8. Withdrawing from the study</b><br/>
                      Participation in this study is voluntary. You may refuse to participate, refuse to answer any questions, or withdraw from the study at any time with no effect on your future academic status. You may withdraw from the study by simply closing your internet browser. Compensation is not dependent on completion of the study; you will still receive the one research credit if you withdraw from the study. If you complete the study but wish to have your data withdrawn from the study, please email Angus Ball at balla2@myumanitoba.ca before July 2024. After July 2024, we may no longer be able to remove individual participant data from the dataset.<br/><br/>
                      <b>9. Debriefing</b><br/>
                      At the end of the study after you have completed your responses, a page will be displayed that explains the details of the study including the hypotheses.<br/><br/>
                      <b>10. Dissemination of study findings</b><br/>
                      The results of the study will be presented at academic conferences and published in academic journals. Results will also be part of a thesis which will be made available on Mspace.<br/><br/>
                      <b>11. Summary of the results</b><br/>
                      We expect to have the study results by July 2024. If you are interested in receiving a summary of the results, please email Angus Ball at balla2@myumanitoba.ca.<br/><br/>
                      <b>12. Retention of data</b><br/>
                      We plan to retain the anonymized data indefinitely for the purpose of future analyses.<br/><br/>
                      <b>By agreeing to participate and continuing to the study, you are indicating that you have understood to your satisfaction the information regarding participation in the research project and agree to participate as a subject.
