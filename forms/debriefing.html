                                Prior research has demonstrated that when an individual has a word on the tip of their
                                tongue, they have access to some information about that word despite not accessing
                                word itself. They may be able to identify the first letter/sound of the word, the number of
                                syllables, or the gender of a word from romance languages. The aim of this study is to
                                assess whether information about the meaning of words is part of this intermediate state
                                of knowledge, which is why definitions were used to initially prompt recall and related
                                words were presented when the word could not be recalled. We hypothesize that
                                people will be able to correctly identify which word is the most closely related to words
                                on the tip of their tongue and that retrieving enough semantic information to make those
                                distinctions will be associated with recalling the word they were struggling with soon
                                afterwards. As aging occurs, people report experiencing tip-of-the-tongue more
                                frequently, and this state of partial retrieval has been linked to communication disorders
                                including dyslexia and anomia. Learning exactly which sources of information are
                                available and unavailable during failed word recall will help clarify where failures occur
                                and may lead to new and improved treatments for communication disorders.<br/><br/>
